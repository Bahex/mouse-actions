# Mouse actions

## Description

mouse_actions allows to execute some command from mouse events such as
clicks/wheel on the side / corners of the screen, or drawing shapes. It's a mix
between Easystroke and Compiz edge commands.

You can click on the top left corder of the screen to go to the first desktop,
or scroll on the top corner to increase/decrease the brightness of the screen,
change the volume... Or draw a T with the right button of the mouse down to
open a terminal, ...

## Features

Bind command execution with mouse button/wheel events (this conditions bellow
are optional):

* shape drawing with the mouse (like Easystroke)
* Press/Release only or click (don't propagate the press & release event)
* with some modifiers : shift/Ctrl/...
* with screen edge : Top/Left ...
* auto reload config on changes

## Project status

**/!\ Alpha version !**

It's works (tested on Linux/X11) but there is no GUI to configure the bindings
for
now, you add to write the json config yourself or use `mouse_actions record`.

I have been using mouse_actions for several days (since 15/05/2022) and X11 has
not crashed (Unlike Easystroke which made X11 crash every day before on my
laptop).

With my usage, mouse_actions triggers commands about once/twice per minute,
and half of which by form shape bindings.

My feedback : after 10 month of daily use and 300'000 triggers,
it's works well.

### Known bugs

* when a device (like mouse or bluetooth earphone ) is added, the mouse/keyboard
  modifier are locked !
* mouse action crash sometimes on trigger xdotool and ... ?

## Install

Download the release, or with Cargo, run directly :

```bash
cargo run
```

or build the binary:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Requirement :

To use the main feature "grab event", you need to add the current user
to `input` & `plugdev` group :

```
sudo usermod -a -G plugdev $USER
sudo usermod -a -G input $USER
```

### Config

Run `mouse_actions record` to init the configuration.

### Configuration

The config file path `~/.config/mouse-actions.json`

#### Structure

* `shape_button`: the mouse button to use to draw shapes :
  `Left` | `Right` | `Middle` | `Side` | `Extra` | `Forward` | `Back`
  | `Task` | `Trigger` | `Thumb` | `Thumb2` | `WheelUp` | `WheelDown`
  | `Unknown` | `None`

* `bindings` : array of binding :
    * `cmd` : command line to exec, as array of string
    * `event`: object :
        * `button`: `Left` | `Right` | `Middle` | `Side` | `Extra` | `Forward`
          | `Back`
          | `Task` | `Trigger` | `Thumb` | `Thumb2` | `WheelUp` | `WheelDown`
          | `Unknown` | `None`
        * `edges`: array of : `Top`,`Right`,`Bottom`,`Left`,
        * `event_type`: `Press` | `Release`| `Click`
        * `modifiers`: array of :  `ShiftLeft`, `ShiftRight`, `ControlLeft`,
          `ControlRight`, `MetaLeft`, `Alt`, `AltGr`
        * `shape`: array of number, the shape angles (radian)...

#### Get shape values

To get a shape angles values, run :

```
mouse_actions trace
```

## Development

This project use [rdev crate](https://crates.io/crates/rdev) that
use [Evdev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evdev) to grab mouse Event.

### Platform compatibility

I only tested on Linux & X11 but it should work on Mac, Windows as well as
Linux+Wayland (with --no-listen option for Wayland).

The `grab` function from rdev give an inaccurate mouse position, so I used
the `listen` function from rdev. This function not works on Wayland, but the
mouse shape detection should work (with little modification of code), the listen
function is used to detect edge of screen click.

## Motivations

* I used [Easystroke](https://github.com/thjaeger/easystroke) a lot but its
  development stopped in 2014, and it causes my system to crash regularly.
* Besides, I was also using a lot Compiz screen corner command bindings, and I
  wanted to have these bindings without necessarily using compiz.

The goal of this project is then to have these 2 features without having
OS crash (X11 crash).

## TODO

### critical

* mouse_action crash sometimes with xdotool command :
  ```
  [INFO  mouse_actions::process_event]      ‚Üí cmd ["xdotool", "key", "49"]
  [xcb] Unknown request in queue while dequeuing
  [xcb] Most likely this is a multi-threaded client and XInitThreads has not been called
  [xcb] Aborting, sorry about that.
  [xcb] Unknown request in queue while dequeuing
  [xcb] Most likely this is a multi-threaded client and XInitThreads has not been called
  [xcb] Aborting, sorry about that.
  mouse_actions: ../../src/xcb_io.c:163: dequeue_pending_request: Assertion `!xcb_xlib_unknown_req_in_deq' failed.
  ```

### High

* the FIXME "inotify CREATE but not DELETE in grab::inotify_devices()" in
  rdev/src/linux/grab.rs:493
* reset the modifiers/button state at root loop restart
* cancel shape if no move after few ms (400 ms ?)

### Medium

* process TODO and FIXME
* refactor
    * reduce clone() usages
    * remove panic
    * reduce unwrap
    * refactor/use Rust best practices
    * refactor Arc/Mutex usages
    * refactor/change the pressState usage
    * dev doc, tests
    * handle errors correctly
    * use anyhow ?
* add more tests
* single instance ‚Üí kill the old instance

### Low

* Ctrl alias for ControlLeft & ControlRight, Shift for ShiftLeft & ShiftRight,
* several event for binding{}
* record : limit float precision
* record : fix cmd split
* pull request/contribute/modify rdev without checkout it in this repo (mouse
  btn add & fix devices setup/Delete notify)
* use rdev send() ? ‚Üí cmd OR sendKeys in bindings (or autopilot-rs) :  trigger
  keyboard event as action (avoid xdotool usage in
  cmd) : https://github.com/Narsil/rdev#sending-some-events
* hide/freeze cursor while shape drawing ?
* better Readme
* detach subprocess (close mouse_actions must not close sub process)
    * workaround : `"cmd": [ "bash", "-c",  "nohup gedit &" ]`

### Maybe

* change config : if shape ‚Üí no need button
* find a better project name
* remove shape_button from config : filter the config bindings to set this value
* GUI (Tauri ?)
* support Wayland & Windows & macOS (get the mouse position on wayland
  impossible ?)
* notif/sound/cursor change on action trigger (configurable) ?
* mouse move edge event ?

## Dev notes

Shape recognition : compare angles, get the average of the angles differences :

![shape-recognition.svg](shape-recognition.svg)

The calculated difference is approximately the area between the 2 curves of
angles (mod 2ùúã) visible on the right of the above image.

Get the minimum difference by shifting a curve horizontally: try removing the
beginning or the end, by +/- 10 % max offset (max 20 try).
